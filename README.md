Ideas:


* map fuel consumption
* by vehicle style/type
* experiments -- what influences decision to use low-emission vehicle?
* location of low emission vehicles? vs demographics?
* route selection mbta + zip + bike paths + hubway
* mash against data.gov green vehicle guide https://explore.data.gov/Transportation/Green-Vehicle-Guide-Data-Downloads/9un4-5bz7
  --> maybe validate data.gov figures for vehicles based on our actual usage
  --> publish an alternative green vehicle guide --
* compare fuel efficiency by driver age
* green reporting api
* use real-time figures from api to power a calculator
* impact of proximity to mass transit
